# Description of assignment 1

### How I approached the problem

I solved the problem with following steps:

- Design the data format that I should use to store index.
- Design the function that parse the raw index file into words.
- Design the regular expression to get the actuall words.
- Complete the collection of the data that are required.
- Design the web page/url.

### Specific design

- I used elementTree.re to do the regular expressions.
- I used boolean function to indicate whether there is a record number in the article.
- I used linear processing in the design, will consider multi-threading in the future.
- I used baseHTTPServer as the web page support.
